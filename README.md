### @mrysav

I joined GitHub in June 2021, but before that I worked for AWS.

A few things about me:

- 🖥️ I've been programming since I was 12. My first language was QBasic.
- 📖 I do occasionnally program outside of work, and usually it's on my homebrew genealogy website ([mrysav/geneac](https://github.com/mrysav/geneac))
-  🏫 I am working on my Masters @ Georgia Tech
