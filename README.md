### @mrysav

Hubber since June 2021!

A few things about me:

- 📦 I work on the Dependency Graph team at GitHub. We make sense of all that crap you put in your `Gemfile`!
- 📖 I enjoy maintaining my homebrew genealogy website ([mrysav/geneac](https://github.com/mrysav/geneac))
- 🩺 I'm a contributor to Georgia Tech's [C4G BLIS](https://github.com/C4G/BLIS/)
- 💎 For web development, Ruby on Rails is where it's at!
- 🏫 I am working through the [OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home) at Georgia Tech and I'm almost done!
