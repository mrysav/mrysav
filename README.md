### @mrysav

Hubber since June 2021!

A few things about me:

- 📦 I work on the Dependency Graph team at GitHub. We make sense of all that crap you put in your `Gemfile`!
- 📖 I do occasionally program outside of work, and usually it's on my homebrew genealogy website ([mrysav/geneac](https://github.com/mrysav/geneac))
- 💎 I love Ruby/Rails and I'm trying to get better at it!
- 🏫 I am working through the [OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home) at Georgia Tech and I'm about halfway through!
